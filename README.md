# Relocating to Berlin

Q&amp;A about relocation to Berlin, Germany. All answers are based on our own experience. 

### How can I submit a question?

Please, create an [Issue](https://github.com/azproduction/relocating-to-berlin/issues/new) a Pull Request. 
Questions are accepted in **English** (in case it is hard for you to express your thoughts in English we would consider Russian as well).
 
## Language

### What level of English is expected from job applicants?

Fluent speaking English is a Must. You should easily cover any IT-topic, including things you are not familiar with.
For example, if you are Frontent specialist try to explain what BEM (Block Element Modifier pattern) is or what is the
difference between CSS position static, absolute and relative or explain Promise to a non-developer.

### Is it worth to learn German in advance?

To a certain level, yes. A1 would be very helpful at the beginning. 
Although it is not mandatory and you can live with 0 level.  

### Can I live without German?

Yes, but it would be tough for a first time, especially in  Burgeramt (most likely) or in Ausländerbehörde (less likely).
Also your Housemeister (the guy who is looking for a house you are renting apartment in), most likely will speak German only.
In some institutions it is mandatory to speak German even to a foreigner and even a person knows English.
In almost all places it will be possible to explain yourself in English.

## Apartment

### Is it hard to rent an apartment for non-Germans? 

The same rules are applied to German and non-German with the permission to live in the country.
The landlord usually is not taking into account from where you are, he most likely would check you current salary level. 
Without a bank account is is impossible to rent anything decent. First pay slip along with a bank statement would also help.
Usually it takes 1+ month to find good apartment, because there are some poor quality places, overpriced or there are
20 applicants for an apartment.

**Mikhail Davydov**: I found one in 2 weeks, but it was an ultimate luck, before that I was renting an apartment on AirBnB 
for 2 months.

**Artem Sapegin**: I found my in 1,5 months but I have two dogs which makes it much more complicated. There are companies like [Berlinovo](https://www.berlinovo.de/en) or [Central Home](https://www.central-home.de/en/home/) where you can rent a flat without registration or bank account. You can register there and live as long as you want (but you probably would not want).

### How expensive apartments are is it expensive?

As of May 2015 the cold prices of the apartments are

 * 1 bed room - 450-650 Euro (have high demand)
 * 2 bed rooms - 850-1000 Euro
 * 3 bed rooms - 1000-1200 Euro
 
For more precise prices, please refer to one of the local real estate websites:

 * http://immobilienscout24.de
 * http://immowelt.de
 * http://immonet.de

### How do I find a flat?

There are a few ways: first it is an agent. If you hire him he will offer you the best apartments in terms of price/quality,
but it will cost you 119-238% of the apartment cold price.

Another way is scout real estate websites:

 * http://immobilienscout24.de
 * http://immowelt.de
 * http://immonet.de
 
**Mikhail Davydov**: I was trying to find a flat on immobilienscout24, all non-agent offers had very poor quality. All agent's flats were very nice.

## Commute

### How much time it takes to get from home to office?

Usually from zone B to zone A or through zone A it takes about 30 minutes. 
On bicycle it could take less, it is convenient  and extremely popular mean of transport.

## General topic

### Why is Germany better than other countries?

**Mikhail Davydov**: Social security, stable economy, it cares of environment, easy to get to any point of europe. 

## Relocation

### What are the main difficulties with relocation?

**Mikhail Davydov**: Besides finding the job remotely, collect, translate all required papers. 

**Artem Sapegin**: You also need a diploma for a Blue Card.

### What are the main difficulties with living in Germany?

**Mikhail Davydov**: Language, I guess. Locals are usually closed to non-German speaking people.

## Jobs

### How do I find an IT job?

Have a well-written profile on http://linkedin.com (must) and http://xing.de (not really required). 
Scout offers on startup jobs or websites of big local companies.

**Mikhail Davydov**: I found mine on Twitter, actually. https://angel.co/ – this one has a big offer list of startup companies.
**Artem Sapegin**: [Stack Overflow](http://careers.stackoverflow.com/cities/berlin) and [Berlin Startup Jobs](http://berlinstartupjobs.com/) are also very good.

### How do I find a non-IT job (e. g. for my wife)? Is it possible?

There is almost no way one can get non-IT, non-Design job without having good level of German. 
To get B2 it would be required to study 4 times a week, 3 hours each day for a year. 
Some professions are required EU-diploma, so it is worth considering studying in local University, 
as state provides free higher education. 

While learning, it is possible to work remotely, but with the obligatory registration 
in Finanzamt as Kleinunternehmer (for instance) at the beginning.

### What kind of salary range should I expect? 

It really depends, please refer to the job posting websites like https://angel.co/ or http://berlinstartupjobs.com/
